**Breed Comparison:**

| Trait | Pug | Golden Retriever |
|-------|-----|------------------|
| Speed | 100% | 110% (Faster!) |
| Jump | 95% | 105% (Higher!) |
| Eating | Instant | 200ms delay |
| Distraction | Never | 15% chance/sec |

**Strategy**: Pug = consistent and reliable. Golden = faster but risky!

#### 🎮 Game Elements Reference

**For detailed game element documentation, see [LEVELS.md](./LEVELS.md)**

**HELPFUL Elements (Collect These!):**
- 🦴 **Treats (Dog Bones)** - Worth 1-3 points based on size
  - Small (1pt): Quick snack, easy to grab
  - Medium (2pt): Better reward, slightly higher
  - Large (3pt): Best reward, usually on high/risky platforms
  - Collect all to win level!
  - Triggers: Gold stars ⭐ + sparkles ✨ particle burst

**HARMFUL Elements (Avoid These!):**
- 💩 **Poo** - Causes damage (-1 heart)
  - Triggers: Dog pukes 🤢 with green streamy particles
  - Triggers: Puking face overlay (X_X eyes)
  - Invincibility: 2 seconds after damage (dog flashes)
  - With stink lines rising (South Park style)

- 🐿️ **Squirrels** - Distract Golden Retriever only (Pug immune)
  - 15% chance per second near Golden
  - Duration: 1.5 seconds
  - Effect: Movement reduced to 50%, jump to 70%
  - Visual: 💭 thought bubble appears
  - **Dangerous on auto-scroll levels** - danger zone catches up!

- 🔴 **Danger Zone** (Levels 2-5 only) - Red gradient on left edge
  - Damage: -1 HP/sec (Levels 2-3), -2 HP/sec (Levels 4-5)
  - Appears when camera auto-scrolls
  - Can't move off-screen past it
  - Must keep moving forward!

- ⬇️ **Falling** - Fall off bottom of screen
  - Level 1: Instant death
  - Levels 2-5: -5 health (unless health < 5, then death)

---

#### 🎯 Core Mechanic: Auto-Scroll "Danger Zone"

**Concept**: Left side of screen slowly scrolls right (like endless runner). If dog gets caught in danger zone = damage/death.

**Thematic Evolution:**
- **Level 1**: No auto-scroll (tutorial level, learn basics)
- **Level 2**: Gentle auto-scroll introduced (danger zone = red gradient edge)
- **Level 3**: Medium scroll (getting harder)
- **Level 4**: Fast scroll (real pressure)
- **Level 5**: Very fast scroll + brutal platforming (World 1 finale!)

---

#### 📊 Health System Overhaul

**Current State (Level 1):**
- ✅ 3 hearts (simple, clear for beginners)
- ✅ Bad items reduce health
- ✅ Fall death = instant game over

**New System (Levels 2-3):**
- 🔲 Expand to **10-point health bar** (percentage-based, more granular)
- 🔲 Multiple damage sources:
  1. **Bad items** (chocolate/grapes) = -2 health
  2. **Danger zone contact** = -1 health per second (continuous drain)
  3. **Fall death** = -5 health (no longer instant death, unless health < 5)
- 🔲 Health UI shows **bar + percentage** instead of hearts (e.g., "Health: 70%")
- 🔲 Color-coded health bar: Green (80-100%), Yellow (40-79%), Red (0-39%)

**Design Rationale:**
- Level 1 keeps 3 hearts for simplicity (gentle onboarding)
- Levels 2-3 introduce complexity gradually
- Health bar allows for more nuanced difficulty tuning

---

#### 🐕 Distraction Mechanic Enhancement

**Current Behavior:**
- Golden Retriever: 15% chance/second to get distracted (1.5s freeze)
- Movement reduced to 50%, jump to 70%

**Enhanced Consequence (Levels 2-3 with auto-scroll):**
- 🔲 While distracted, **danger zone continues advancing**
- 🔲 Dog cannot move forward → gets closer to danger zone
- 🔲 **High risk/high reward**: Golden's speed advantage comes with danger zone pressure
- 🔲 Pug's reliability becomes strategic advantage (no distractions = safer pacing)

**Gameplay Impact:**
- Golden Retriever: Fast but risky (distractions can be deadly with auto-scroll)
- Pug: Slower but consistent (better for auto-scroll levels)
- Breeds now have **level-specific advantages** (replay value!)

---

#### 📋 Implementation Checklist

**Phase 1: Health System Refactor (Level 1 consistency)**
- ✅ Create abstract health system that supports both hearts (Level 1) and 10 hearts (Levels 2-3)
- ✅ Refactor `UIScene` to display health based on level configuration
- ✅ Add `LevelConfig` type with level-specific settings

## Critical Bug Fixes Applied

Throughout development, 6 critical bugs were identified and fixed:

1. **Game Over input not responding** - Added multiple input methods (SPACE, click, any key)
2. **Multiple game over triggers** - Added `gameOver` flag and physics pause on end conditions
3. **Treats not resetting on restart** - Properly stop and reset GameScene state arrays
4. **Menu SPACE key not working on return visits** - Fixed event listener management (`.on` instead of `.once`)
5. **Breed Select SPACE key not working** - Cleaned up duplicate listeners, used `.once` with cleanup
6. **UIScene race condition crash** - Added 100ms delay for UI updates and safety checks

All fixes committed in separate commits for traceability.

## Post-MVP Ideas (Backlog)

### High Priority
- **More dog breeds** - Chihuahua (jumps high), Corgi (fast runner), Husky (strong/tanky)
- **Sound effects** - Jump, eat, damage, win/lose
- **Background music** - Looping 8-bit chiptune track

### Medium Priority
- **Power-ups** - Speed boost, invincibility star, magnet for treats
- **Moving obstacles** - Bouncing balls, sliding chocolate bars
- **Save progress** - LocalStorage for level unlocks and best times
- **Leaderboard** - Time-based scoring system

### Low Priority
- **Boss levels** - Special challenge levels with unique mechanics
- **Mobile touch controls** - Virtual joystick for mobile play
- **Achievements** - Complete all levels, no-damage run, speed runs
- **Pixel art sprites** - Replace programmatic graphics with custom pixel art (after Milestone 10)

## Development Status Summary

**Completed**: 9 out of 10 milestones ✅  
**In Progress**: None - Ready for expansion! 🚀  
**MVP Status**: Complete and deployed with 3-level progression! 🎉  

**Current Focus**: 
1. Visual style overhaul with **"South Park construction paper"** aesthetic (pivot from Angry Birds)
2. Enhanced animations (squash/stretch, elastic easing)
3. Gross humor effects (South Park-style puke, stink lines)
4. Flat filled shapes with thin internal details

**Upcoming: Milestone 8 Redesign** 🎯
- **New Vision**: Auto-scroll "chase" mechanic (owner pursuing escaped dog)
- **Health Evolution**: 3 hearts (L1) → 10-point bar (L2-3) with multiple damage sources
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Level 1 (tutorial), Level 2 (gentle auto-scroll), Level 3 (fast chase)
- **Strategic Depth**: Distractions become dangerous with auto-scroll (risk/reward)

**Next Steps After Milestone 10**: 
1. Complete visual polish and share for feedback
2. Begin Milestone 8: Health system refactor + auto-scroll implementation
3. Design Levels 2-3 with progressive difficulty curve
