# 🐕 Dog Treat Side Scroller

A fun 8-bit style side-scrolling game where different dog breeds collect treats while avoiding harmful foods!

## 🎮 Game Concept

Control various dog breeds as they run through levels collecting treats. Each breed has unique traits:
- **Pugs**: Fast eaters, can gobble up treats quickly
- **Golden Retrievers**: Easily distracted (coming soon!)

Collect treats to pass levels, but watch out for dangerous foods like chocolate and grapes that will damage your health!
