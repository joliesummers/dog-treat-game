### ✅ Milestone 1: "Hello Dog" - Core Movement (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Player can see and control a dog character on screen

- ✅ Set up new Phaser + TypeScript + Vite project structure
- ✅ Configure basic game scene with physics
- ✅ Add placeholder dog sprite (or find free dog sprite)
- ✅ Implement left/right keyboard movement with ground friction
- ✅ Implement jump physics with gravity
- ✅ Add basic ground platform
- ✅ **Playable test**: Dog runs and jumps smoothly

**Status**: Dog entity created with physics-based movement, jumping, and platform collision!

### ✅ Milestone 2: "Treat Collector" - Core Game Loop (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Core "eat treat to win" mechanic works

- ✅ Add treat sprite/object on the level
- ✅ Implement collision detection between dog and treat
- ✅ Add "eating" animation or effect (sprite disappear, sound)
- ✅ Display treat counter on UI
- ✅ Add simple win condition (collect X treats to finish level)
- ✅ Show basic "Level Complete" screen
- ✅ **Playable test**: Can collect treats and complete the level

**Status**: 10 treats placed in level, collection mechanics working, UI tracking, level complete screen implemented!

### ✅ Milestone 3: "Dangerous Snacks" - Health System (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Risk/reward gameplay with bad items

- ✅ Add "bad item" sprites (chocolate, grapes, etc.)
- ✅ Implement health points system (start with 3 hearts)
- ✅ Display health UI (hearts/bar)
- ✅ Collision with bad items reduces health
- ✅ Add lose condition (health reaches zero)
- ✅ Show "Game Over" screen with restart option
- ✅ Add invincibility frames after taking damage (visual feedback)
- ✅ **Playable test**: Player must avoid bad items or lose

**Status**: Health system implemented with 3 hearts, bad items (chocolate/grapes), invincibility frames, flash damage feedback, and game over screen!

**Enhancements Added:**
- Mixed bad items: 4 static on platforms + falling items from sky every 3-5 seconds
- Falling items have gravity enabled and bounce off platforms
- Dynamic hazards make health system more challenging and testable!

### ✅ Milestone 4: "Level Design" - First Complete Level (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Full level experience with pacing and challenge

- ✅ Integrate Tiled map editor for level design (deferred for later iteration)
- ✅ Create first level layout with multiple platforms
- ✅ Add 12 treats strategically placed
- ✅ Add 8 bad items as obstacles
- ✅ Implement level boundaries and fall death
- ✅ Add background layer (sky gradient)
- ✅ Tune jump height, movement speed, treat/obstacle placement
- ✅ **Playable test**: Balanced level that takes 30-60 seconds to complete

**Status**: Level 1 complete with 4 platforms, varied heights, strategic item placement, fall detection, and tuned physics!

### ✅ Milestone 5: "Pug Power" - Dog Breed Traits (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Unique character with special abilities

- ✅ Create dog stats system (speed, eat_speed, distraction_chance)
- ✅ Implement Pug traits: fast eating, instant collection
- ✅ Add eating animation/delay based on breed
- ✅ Show breed name and stats on start screen
- ✅ Add breed selection screen (even if only 1 breed initially)
- ✅ **Playable test**: Pug feels different from baseline (faster eating)

**Status**: Breed system implemented! Pug has instant eating, breed selection screen shows stats, different breeds have different movement/jump multipliers!

### ✅ Milestone 6: "Polish & Juice" - Game Feel (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Game feels satisfying to play

- ⏭️ Add sound effects (jump, eat, damage, win/lose) - Deferred
- ✅ Add particle effects (treat sparkle, damage flash)
- ✅ Implement camera follow/smooth tracking
- ✅ Add start menu with "Play" button
- ✅ Add pause functionality (P key)
- ✅ Improve UI styling (retro pixel font)
- ⏭️ Add background music (looping 8-bit track) - Deferred
- ✅ **Playable test**: Game feels responsive and rewarding

**Status**: Main menu with animations, pause overlay, particle effects for collecting/damage, camera follows player smoothly!

### ✅ Milestone 7: "More Breeds" - Golden Retriever (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Replayability with different playstyles

- ✅ Add Golden Retriever sprite (golden color placeholder)
- ✅ Implement distraction mechanic (15% chance per second, 1.5s pause)
- ✅ Add visual indicator for distraction (💭 thought bubble with animation)
- ✅ Update breed selection screen with 2 choices (side-by-side)
- ✅ Balance traits so both breeds are viable
- ✅ **Playable test**: Both breeds offer distinct strategies

**Status**: Golden Retriever added with faster speed (110%), better jump (105%), but gets distracted randomly. Breed selection shows both dogs with click-to-select UI!

**Enhancements Added:**
- When distracted: 50% movement speed and 70% jump power (impaired control)
- Thought bubble (💭) indicator bounces above dog during distraction
- Makes Golden Retriever high-risk, high-reward playstyle!

### Milestone 8: "Level 2 & 3" - Content Expansion (Week 5-6)

**Value**: Extended gameplay with progression

- [ ] Design 2 additional levels with increasing difficulty
- [ ] Add level selection screen
- [ ] Implement level unlock system (beat 1 to unlock 2)
- [ ] Vary obstacles/layout per level (gaps, moving platforms optional)
- [ ] Add level transition screens
- [ ] **Playable test**: 3-level progression feels rewarding

### ✅ Milestone 9: "Deploy & Share" - Production Ready (COMPLETED)

**Value**: Game is publicly playable

- ✅ Build production bundle with Vite
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages (automated via GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Add meta tags for social sharing
- ✅ Create comprehensive README with controls instructions
- ✅ Test on different browsers (builds successfully)
